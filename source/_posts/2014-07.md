All,

Apologies for the mass of emails:

It has been brought to our attention that there was a missing section
to the IBAN number that was in the original renewal mail.

The CORRECT IBAN IS:
IE59BOFI90675027999600


Apologies for the inconvenience,
A second email has been sent to those who have yet to renew.

Regards,

Richard Walsh (koffee)
Redbrick Admin
